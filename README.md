**Project Description**
We have created a Moodboard!
Think Pinterest but better (that's a bit of a claim BUT you gotta big yourself up sometimes) 

The platform allows users to explore and save images sourced from an open-source repository to their personalized moodboards. 


**Problem Domain and User Stories**
Our focus lies in providing a solution for users who desire a dedicated space for visual inspiration and expression. 
The platform caters to individuals across various interests and professions, offering them the ability to effortlessly discover and collect images that resonate with their moods and creative preferences. 
User stories include scenarios where users can easily navigate the open-source image repository, save preferred images to their moodboards, and ultimately curate a personalized visual journey. 
The goal is to enhance the user experience by providing a seamless and engaging platform for creative expression and inspiration.


**Prior Use Good-To-Knows**
The user has to be 'logged in' in order to interact with the site and begin saving images to their own moodboards. They are prompted to select their name from the dropdown or to enter their name if it's not already there upon landing on the page with a popup.



**Inital Planning**
Our brainstorming documents and wireframes can be found at the following link: https://www.figma.com/files/project/180553372?fuid=1323944808115524491
We started our project in a FigmaJam board for brainstorming. At this stage, we defined our MVP as well as identifying stretch goals and we began my compiling bits of inspiration including snippets of code or screenshots of competitor web applications.
After brainstorming, we drew low-fidelity wireframes collaboratively in Figma.
